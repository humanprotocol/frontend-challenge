# frontend-challenge

**Introduction**

The goal is to check your skills on building a Dapp (decentralized application, aka an application that uses blockchain as backend).

You can fork this repository which contains all the dependencies you'll need: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com) and [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).

**Assignment**

Please create a Dapp to interact with [0xd054e5724d7d595b72abbb0c460e0221cd859c8f](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd054e5724d7d595b72abbb0c460e0221cd859c8f) on Goerli testnet.

Please build an app that:

- Contains a form which on submit calls `sayMeow()` on our contract
- Displays all the `mews` returned by `getAllMeows()`
- Uses Material UI

You can go with a 2-pages or single page architecture, the choice is yours. Same goes for naming, folders, and so on...

- [ ] Connect a wallet
- [ ] Read a contract
- [ ] Write on a contract
- [ ] React & NextJS
